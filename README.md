# Find A Flag 3000

This projects provides a idea into my approach with regards to project setup, UI design, and general best practices.

## To get started

- Download the repo;
- run `npm install` in the root (npm/node are running on 8.5.5 and 16.15.0 respectively);
- run `npm run dev` to spin up the frontend from the root folder;
- run `node index.js` to spin up the backend service from the `server` folder (this service runs on port 3001)
- After this, you should be good to navigate to the project in your browser and interact accordingly.

**NOTE** -- You can run `npm test` to run the small suite of tests for the FE from the root folder.
